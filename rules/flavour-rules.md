# Flavour Rules

optional interesting extra rules that can be included in missions. 

- Blackstone Flux (global surge):
  - At the start of each battle round, roll one D3 and apply until the round ends:
    1. Null Surge: Units within 3" of any objective cannot use invulnerable saves.
    2. Gravity Shear: Subtract 1 from Advance and Charge rolls for units not wholly within a deployment zone.
    3. Conduit Flare: Mission Actions that target an objective marker complete at the end of your Movement phase instead of the end of your turn.
- Null-Zone Pockets:
  - The areas within 6" of O3 and O4 are null zones. Units in a null zone cannot be affected by abilities that grant re-rolls (excluding Battle-shock re-rolls) and cannot be targeted by Stratagems from outside the null zone (Stratagems used by units within the same null zone are allowed).
- Ash Storms:
  - During battle rounds 1 and 4, ranged attacks beyond 18" are -1 to Hit. In those rounds, units wholly within or touching Area Terrain ignore this penalty when targeting or being targeted by units also wholly within or touching Area Terrain.
- Vault Feedback:
  - Each time a unit fails a Mission Action within 6" of O3 or O4, roll one D6: on a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
