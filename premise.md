# Ashes of Solcaris

On the dying world of Solcaris Prime, Imperial forces uncover a long-buried Blackstone vault. Its activation has drawn the attention of the Necrons, Orks, and Chaos cults. The planet’s surface fractures under endless war as each faction fights to claim or destroy the artifact.

## Intro 

The world of Solcaris Prime is dying.

Once a proud forge-world, its hives now stand as hollow tombs, their skies blackened with ash from centuries of war and strip-mining. Across its wastes, scavengers pick through rust and ruin, while ancient secrets lie buried deep beneath the earth.

Recently, the planet’s crust split open in Hive Karythus, revealing a vast Blackstone vault—its cyclopean doors pulsing with a light not seen for millennia. The discovery has echoed across the void like a beacon, drawing the eyes of countless powers.

The Imperium seeks to reclaim its lost world. Cults and warlords rise from the ash to seize it in the name of darker gods. And alien forces close in, each hungering for the prize buried beneath the planet’s surface.

Solcaris Prime burns, and in its flames, war without end begins anew. These are the Ashes of Solcaris.
