# Quantum Siege — 4-Player Map (Pariah Nexus Variant)

- Date: 2025-09-10
- Battlefield Size: 60"x44"
- Players: 4 (FFA)
- Summary: Four forces converge to breach quantum nodes amid null interference from the Blackstone vault.

## Coordinate System
- Origin (0,0) bottom-left; x increases to the right, y increases up. Units in inches.

## Deployment Zones
- DZ-A: Rectangle x ∈ [0, 27], y ∈ [0, 19].
- DZ-B: Rectangle x ∈ [33, 60], y ∈ [0, 19].
- DZ-C: Rectangle x ∈ [0, 27], y ∈ [25, 44].
- DZ-D: Rectangle x ∈ [33, 60], y ∈ [25, 44].
- Notes:
  - The central neutral cross (no player's DZ) is x ∈ [27, 33] and y ∈ [19, 25].
  - Units cannot be set up with any base crossing a DZ boundary or outside their assigned DZ.

## Objective Markers
- Total: 8
- Placement rules:
  - Each objective must be at least 6" from any battlefield edge.
  - Each objective must be at least 9" from any other objective.
  - Objectives may be within deployment zones.
- Locations:
  - Objective 1: (12, 11)
  - Objective 2: (30, 11)
  - Objective 3: (48, 11)
  - Objective 4: (12, 22)
  - Objective 5: (48, 22)
  - Objective 6: (12, 33)
  - Objective 7: (30, 33)
  - Objective 8: (48, 33)

## Mission Rules (4-Player Adaptation)
- Turn Order: For Battle Round 1, randomly determine A→B→C→D. From BR2 onward, use serpentine order: the last player of the previous round acts first next round and turn order reverses (e.g., A→B→C→D then D→C→B→A, repeat).
- Command Points: Each player starts with 0 CP and gains 1 CP at the start of their Command phase. Max CP 6 per player.
- Battle Length: 5 battle rounds. If time expires, finish the current battle round, then end the battle.
- Reserves/Reinforcements:
  - Units in Reserves can arrive in their owning player’s Movement phase from BR2 onward.
  - Arrival edges are the battlefield edges that border your DZ; use the segments adjacent to your DZ when an edge is shared:
    - A: bottom edge x ∈ [0, 27] and left edge y ∈ [0, 19]
    - B: bottom edge x ∈ [33, 60] and right edge y ∈ [0, 19]
    - C: top edge x ∈ [0, 27] and left edge y ∈ [25, 44]
    - D: top edge x ∈ [33, 60] and right edge y ∈ [25, 44]
  - Standard arrival restrictions apply (e.g., must be set up wholly within 6" of the chosen edge and more than 9" from enemy models).
- Scoring:
  - Primary (Adaptation — Take and Hold): At the end of your Command phase from BR2 onward, score:
    - 5 VP if you control 1+ objectives,
    - 5 VP if you control 2+ objectives,
    - 5 VP if you control the most objectives (outright) at that moment among all players.
    - Max 15 VP per player per round.
  - Secondary: Use your campaign/Crusade secondaries as normal. If a mission-specific secondary is desired, use the minimal adaptation “Quantum Breach”: once per turn, one unit you control on an objective outside your DZ can perform an action (start of your Shooting phase; unit cannot shoot or declare a charge this turn). It completes at the end of your turn if you still control that objective; score 3 VP. Each objective can be Breached once per battle.
- Additional Effects (Pariah Nexus — summarized): If your group uses Pariah Nexus null-zone rules, apply them. Otherwise, use this minimal adaptation: while a unit is within 6" of the board center (30, 22), it cannot be affected by aura abilities and any Stratagem used on that unit costs +1 CP (to a minimum of 0).

## Setup Steps
1. Set battlefield size and orient the coordinate system.
2. Mark deployment zones (DZ-A to DZ-D) as above, leaving the central neutral cross unclaimed.
3. Place objective markers at the listed coordinates and enforce the placement rules.
4. Place terrain to keep firing lanes and approach routes fair for all DZs; do not fully block the central lanes.
5. Determine alliances if playing 2v2; otherwise, play FFA.
6. Roll for turn order and begin the battle.

## Victory
- Highest total VP at battle end wins. Tie-breaker: most objectives controlled at the end of the battle; if still tied, the tied players roll off.
