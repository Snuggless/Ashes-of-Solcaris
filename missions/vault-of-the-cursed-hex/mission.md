# Vault of the Cursed Hex

> The Blackstone vault pulses with a malignant energy, warping reality and cursing all who draw near. Four rival warbands converge, each desperate to seize its power—or survive its wrath.

## Mission Briefing
The vault beneath Hive Karythus has erupted with a hexed surge, twisting the battlefield with unpredictable energies. Ash storms swirl, null-zones flicker, and the very ground is laced with Blackstone flux. Each force must brave the cursed terrain, outmaneuver rivals, and claim the vault’s secrets before the malediction consumes all. Only the bold—or the damned—will emerge victorious.

## The Battlefield
- Size: 60"x44" (for 44"x30", use 4 objectives and shrink deployment zones by 6")
- Terrain: Industrial, Ruins, Ash, Mechanicus
- Objective Markers: 6 total, placed as shown below (O1–O6)

### Map & Deployment (4 Players)

```
    N
W +------------------------------+ E
  |   O1         O2         O3   |
  |  A  -----DZ A-----  B        |
  |   O4    O6    O5             |
  |  C  -----DZ C-----  D        |
  |                              |

```
- O6 is the Vault Core (center). O1–O5 are spaced evenly around the center, 12" from the nearest board edge and 18" from O6.
- Deployment: Each player randomly draws a zone (A–D). Roll-off for order; ties re-roll.
- First Battle Round: Highest roll chooses to go first or last; proceed clockwise.
- Reserves/Deep Strike: Allowed, but units arriving within 6" of O6 suffer a mortal wound on a 4+.

## Primary Mission: Cursed Vault Control
- Score 3 VP at the end of your turn for each objective you control (max 9 VP/turn).
- O6 (Vault Core) is worth 2 additional VP if controlled at turn end.
- Endgame: Control O6 at battle’s end for 5 bonus VP.

## Secondary Objectives (Choose 2)
1. Hexed Harvest — Score 2 VP each time you complete a Salvage Archeotech action.
2. Malediction’s Mark — Score 3 VP the first time you destroy a unit wholly within 6" of O6 each round.
3. Ashen Advance — Score 2 VP if you control an objective in an enemy deployment zone at turn end.
4. Null’s Embrace — Score 2 VP if you begin and end your turn with a unit wholly within a null-zone (O2 or O5, within 6").

## Mission Rules
- **Blackstone Flux (Global Surge):** At the start of each battle round, roll a D3:
  1. Null Surge: Units within 3" of any objective cannot use invulnerable saves.
  2. Gravity Shear: Subtract 1 from Advance and Charge rolls for units not wholly within a deployment zone.
  3. Conduit Flare: Mission Actions targeting objectives complete at the end of your Movement phase instead of turn end.
- **Null-Zone Pockets:** Areas within 6" of O2 and O5 are null-zones. Units here cannot benefit from re-rolls (except Battle-shock) and cannot be targeted by Stratagems from outside the zone.
- **Ash Storms:** During battle rounds 1 and 4, ranged attacks beyond 18" are -1 to Hit. Units wholly within or touching Area Terrain ignore this penalty when targeting or being targeted by other such units.
- **Vault Feedback:** Each time a unit fails a Mission Action within 6" of O2 or O5, roll a D6: on a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
- **Cursed Ground:** At the end of each player’s turn, roll a D6 for each of their units within 6" of O6. On a 6, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound (no save).

## options
- Blackstone Flux
- Null-Zone Pockets
- Ash Storms
- Vault Feedback
- Salvage Archeotech

### Actions
- **Salvage Archeotech (Action):**
  - When: End of your Movement phase.
  - Who: Any Infantry or Biker unit not Battle-shocked, within 3" of an objective you control.
  - Time: 1 unit per objective per turn.
  - Success: Gain 1 Salvage token (max 3 per player). Each token is worth 1 VP at game end, or may be spent to re-roll a single die (once per token, once per phase).

## Agendas (Crusade)
- **Hexbound Seekers** — Gain 2 XP for each Salvage Archeotech action completed by a unit.
- **Vault’s Cursebearer** — Gain 3 XP for a unit that ends a battle round within 3" of O6.
- **Ash-Wreathed Hunters** — Gain 1 XP for each enemy unit destroyed in or within 6" of a null-zone.
- **Malediction’s Survivor** — Gain 2 XP for a unit that survives the battle after suffering mortal wounds from Cursed Ground or Vault Feedback.

## Rewards & Risks (Crusade)
- **Mission Bonus:** Victor may select a unit to gain a free Relic (Crusade rarity 2 or less) or +1 Requisition.
- **Requisition Hooks:** All players may purchase the "Hexed Salvage" Requisition to upgrade a unit with a Blackstone-infused weapon (see campaign rules).
- **Archeotech Cache:** Any player with 3 Salvage tokens may roll a D6 post-battle; on a 5+, gain a unique campaign Relic.
- **Battle Scars:** Any unit destroyed by Vault Feedback or Cursed Ground must roll for a Battle Scar after the game.

## Setup Steps (Checklist)
1. Agree battle size, points per player (suggested: 1375), and battlefield size.
2. Place terrain matching Industrial/Ash Wastes with at least 2 large LOS blockers.
3. Place objective markers as shown on the map.
4. Randomly assign deployment zones A–D.
5. Declare Reserves and reveal any pre-game abilities.
6. Deploy in order; then begin the first battle round.

## Battle Length & Victory
- Battle Length: 5 rounds.
- Victory: Highest total VP; ties break by Primary VP > Secondaries > Destroyed Points > roll-off.
- Sportsmanship/Time: Keep pace and call last round at 20 minutes remaining.

## Designer Notes
This mission is designed to feel truly cursed: unpredictable Blackstone surges, punishing null-zones, and a central vault that tempts and punishes in equal measure. For a shorter game, reduce objectives to 4 and omit Cursed Ground. For 6 players, add two more deployment zones and objectives at the board edges.
