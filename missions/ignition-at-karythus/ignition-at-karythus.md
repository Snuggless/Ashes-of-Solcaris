# Ignition at Karythus

> The vault beneath Hive Karythus has awakened, bleeding null-light through the ash-choked streets. Four forces rush to seize the power nodes before the Blackstone lattice stabilizes.

## Mission Briefing
The breach alarms have barely ceased when the vault’s surface glyphs flare, forming a lattice of power across the district. Control of the exposed nodes will decide who shapes the opening moves of this campaign. The null-field waxes and wanes in dangerous pulses; weapons sputter, auto-senses blind, and machine-spirits wail. Take ground, hold the nodes through the surges, and extract whatever data or relics you can before the vault settles into a deadlier rhythm.

## The Battlefield
- Size: 60"x44" (Incursion variant: 44"x30" — reduce all distances by 25% and remove Objective 6)
- Terrain: Industrial, Ruins, Mechanicus, Ash Wastes; at least 2 substantial LOS blockers
- Objective Markers: 6 total
  - O1: 12" from West edge, 16" from North edge
  - O2: 12" from East edge, 16" from North edge
  - O3: 6" West of center
  - O4: 6" East of center
  - O5: 12" from West edge, 16" from South edge
  - O6: 12" from East edge, 16" from South edge

- Deployment:
  - Divide the battlefield into four corner zones A–D. Each zone is a 16"-deep triangular/corner region: from each short edge, measure 16" along both adjacent board edges and connect to form each corner deployment zone.
  - Randomly determine pick order; players select unique zones A–D in that order (re-roll ties).
- First Battle Round:
  - After deployment, each player rolls off. Highest chooses their position in the turn order; proceed clockwise around the table from that player. On ties, re-roll.
- Reserves/Deep Strike:
  - Core rules apply. On the turn they arrive, units cannot be set up within another player’s deployment zone. Deep Strike is permitted from the first battle round but must be wholly within your own table half (longways).

## Primary Mission: Vault Ignition Protocols
Score at the end of your turn. Cap 8VP per player turn from this Primary (before bonuses).

- Hold Objectives:
  - 2VP if you control at least 1 objective.
  - +2VP if you control at least 2 objectives.
  - +2VP if you control more objectives than each adjacent opponent (players seated to your left and right in turn order).
- Power Nodes:
  - While you control O2 and/or O5 at the end of your turn, score +1VP per node (does not count toward the 8VP cap; max +2VP/turn).
- Endgame Bonus:
  - At the end of the battle, if you control both central nodes (O3 and O4), score +5VP.

## Secondary Objectives (Choose 2)
1. Stabilize the Grid — Score 4VP the first time you successfully complete Stabilize Relay (Action) on two different objectives.
2. Cut the Null — Score 3VP in a battle round if one or more enemy units are destroyed while within 6" of O3 or O4.
3. Ash-Born Ambush — Score 4VP the first time you destroy an enemy unit in the same turn it arrived from Reserves or Deep Strike.
4. Data-Haul — Score 3VP each time you successfully complete Salvage Archeotech (Action); max 6VP.
5. Deny the Surge — Score 4VP the first time you complete Countermeasure Spike (Action).

## Mission Rules
- Blackstone Flux (global surge):
  - At the start of each battle round, roll one D3 and apply until the round ends:
    1. Null Surge: Units within 3" of any objective cannot use invulnerable saves.
    2. Gravity Shear: Subtract 1 from Advance and Charge rolls for units not wholly within a deployment zone.
    3. Conduit Flare: Mission Actions that target an objective marker complete at the end of your Movement phase instead of the end of your turn.
- Null-Zone Pockets:
  - The areas within 6" of O3 and O4 are null zones. Units in a null zone cannot be affected by abilities that grant re-rolls (excluding Battle-shock re-rolls) and cannot be targeted by Stratagems from outside the null zone (Stratagems used by units within the same null zone are allowed).
- Ash Storms:
  - During battle rounds 1 and 4, ranged attacks beyond 18" are -1 to Hit. In those rounds, units wholly within or touching Area Terrain ignore this penalty when targeting or being targeted by units also wholly within or touching Area Terrain.
- Vault Feedback:
  - Each time a unit fails a Mission Action within 6" of O3 or O4, roll one D6: on a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

### Actions
- Stabilize Relay (Action)
  - When: Your Movement phase.
  - Who: One Infantry or Battleline unit (not Battle-shocked) within 3" of any objective you control.
  - Time: Unit must Remain Stationary this phase; completes at end of your turn (or Movement phase during Conduit Flare).
  - Success: Place a “Stabilized” token on that objective (yours). While stabilized by you, enemy units treat it as if they are not within range for contesting unless they have Objective Control (OC) 3+ per model. Remove the token if an enemy completes this action on the same objective.
- Salvage Archeotech (Action)
  - When: Your Movement phase.
  - Who: One Infantry, Biker, or Walker unit (not Battle-shocked) wholly within or touching a Terrain feature (not within an enemy deployment zone).
  - Time: Unit must Remain Stationary; completes at end of your turn (or Movement phase during Conduit Flare).
  - Success: Gain 1 Salvage card/token. Score 3VP (Secondary: Data-Haul). In Crusade, see Archeotech Cache under Rewards.
  - Limit: Each Terrain feature can be salvaged once per battle.
- Countermeasure Spike (Action)
  - When: Your Movement phase.
  - Who: One Character or Vehicle unit (not Battle-shocked) within 3" of O3 or O4.
  - Time: Unit must Remain Stationary; completes at end of your turn (or Movement phase during Conduit Flare).
  - Success: Until the start of your next turn, ignore Blackstone Flux and Null-Zone Pockets within 6" of that objective for your army. Score 4VP (Secondary: Deny the Surge).

## Agendas (Crusade)
- Vault Whisperers — Units earn 2XP each time they complete Stabilize Relay; +1XP if completed within 6" of O3 or O4.
- Dust-Rakers — Units earn 2XP when they complete Salvage Archeotech; +1XP if they carried a Salvage token at the end of the battle.
- Storm Stalkers — Units earn 1XP each time they destroy an enemy unit during an Ash Storm round; +1XP if the destroyed unit arrived from Reserves this battle.
- Node Wardens — A unit that ends your turn controlling O2 or O5 earns 1XP (max 3XP per unit per battle).

## Rewards & Risks (Crusade)
- Mission Bonus:
  - Victor chooses one:
    - Vault Key (1 use): Before a battle round begins, declare: your army treats Conduit Flare as active this round.
    - Ash Wards: Pick one unit; once next battle, ignore all modifiers to Advance/Charge rolls for that unit until end of a turn.
- Requisition Hooks:
  - Explorator Convoy (1RP): Add a free Dedicated Transport (patrol grade) to your Order of Battle; it must begin the next battle with a Salvage token.
  - Null Harmonics (1RP): One Psyker or Tech unit gains a once-per-battle 6" aura that ignores Null-Zone Pockets for friendly units during your turn.
- Archeotech Cache:
  - For each Salvage token held at battle end, you may test for a find: On a 5+, gain one Archeotech part. Three parts can be combined after any future battle into a Rare Crusade Relic themed to Solcaris (GM approves exact item).
- Battle Scars:
  - Any unit destroyed by Vault Feedback must take an additional Out of Action test with a -1 penalty. If failed, the scar is “Blackstone Scorched” (GM: impose a fitting penalty to movement/advance until repaired).

## Setup Steps (Checklist)
1. Agree battle size (recommended Strike Force), 1000 points per player, and battlefield size (60"x44").
2. Place terrain: Industrial/Ash Wastes with at least 2 large LOS blockers; mark 2–4 features as “Archeotech” if desired.
3. Place objective markers O1–O6 as specified.
4. Determine pick order; select deployment zones A–D.
5. Declare Reserves and reveal pre-game abilities.
6. Deploy in order; roll for turn order; begin the first battle round.

## Battle Length & Victory
- Battle Length: 5 battle rounds.
- Victory: Highest total VP. Ties break by Primary VP > number of Stabilized objectives you finished > total enemy points destroyed > roll-off.
- Sportsmanship/Time: Keep pace; at 20 minutes remaining, call the final battle round.

## Designer Notes (Optional)
This mission aims for fast scoring with positional friction around O3/O4. To scale down (Incursion), remove O6, tighten deployment to 12", and reduce the Primary cap to 6VP per turn. For a nastier variant, extend Null-Zone Pockets to 9" but reduce Ash Storms to round 1 only.
