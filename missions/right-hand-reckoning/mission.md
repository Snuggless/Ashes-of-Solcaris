# Right-Hand Reckoning

> The vault’s malediction twists fate itself, binding warriors into a spiral of grudges. On Solcaris Prime, every blade finds its destined throat—the foe to your right.

## Mission Briefing
The Blackstone beneath Hive Karythus flares with a directional curse—each warband feels an irresistible pull toward the enemy seated to their right. Every scrap of glory and every drop of blood the vault will recognize only if offered from that rival. Four forces must commit to the clockwise feud, weathering null-zones and ash storms as the vault punishes meddling in other duels.

## The Battlefield
- Size: 60"x44"

### Map & Deployment (4 Players)
Provide seating clockwise around the table: A (NW), B (NE), D (SE), C (SW).

- Deployment: Each player rolls; highest chooses a deployment zone (A–D), then proceed clockwise for remaining choices. After deployment, establish Rival order clockwise: A targets B, B targets D, D targets C, C targets A.
- First Battle Round: Roll off; winner chooses to take the first turn; play proceeds clockwise around the table each battle round.
- Reserves/Deep Strike: Allowed as normal. Units set up within 6" of O6 must take a Battleshock test; if failed, they cannot charge this turn.

## Primary Mission: Right-Hand Retribution
Score Victory points only for damaging your designated Rival. You cannot score VP from any other player’s units unless a rule explicitly says otherwise.

- End of Your Turn: Tally Rivalry Damage dealt by your army to your Rival this turn. Score 2 VP for each full 10 wounds lost by your Rival’s units this turn (rounding down), to a maximum of 8 VP from this clause per turn.
- Bounty Finisher: Score +2 VP for each of your Rival’s units destroyed by your army this turn (max +4 per turn from this clause).
- Round Cap: 12 VP maximum per player turn from the Primary.
- Clarifications:
  - Count only wounds lost due to your army’s attacks, abilities, or rules resolved in your turn. Healing later does not reduce VP already earned.
  - Destroyed Transport models contribute their remaining wounds at the moment they were destroyed. Spilled-out passengers are counted separately if later damaged.

## Secondary Objectives
All secondaries only score against your designated Rival.

1. Cut the Reinforcements — Score 3 VP the first time in the battle you destroy a Rival unit that arrived from Reserves or was set up from Deep Strike this round; 1 VP for each subsequent time (max 5 VP total from this secondary).
2. Deny the Interloper — Score 2 VP at the end of your turn if none of your units declared attacks against any non-Rival units this turn and you destroyed at least one Rival unit.

## Rewards & Risks (Crusade)
- Mission Bonus: The victor may choose one unit to gain a Cursed Blackstone Trinket (campaign Relic hook)

## Setup Steps (Checklist)
1. Agree battle size, points per player (suggested: 1200), and battlefield size.
2. Place terrain to match Industrial/Ash Wastes with at least two substantial LOS blockers and multiple Area Terrain pieces.
3. Place objective markers as shown; confirm O6 is centered.
4. Roll to select deployment zones clockwise; seat players A, B, D, C in that order around the table.
5. Determine Rival pairings clockwise: A→B, B→D, D→C, C→A. Share this openly.
6. Declare Reserves and reveal pre-game rules; deploy; begin the first battle round.

## Battle Length & Victory
- Battle Length: 5 battle rounds.
- Victory: Highest total VP. Ties break by Primary VP > number of Rival units destroyed > total enemy points destroyed (only your Rival’s) > roll-off.
